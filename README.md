# FastFoodApp
This is my senior project for my Information Systems major. It is an application for a fast-food restaurant with 3 different types of users and functionalities. The application allows for the customers to view, create, and order products, the employees to view and complete orders and also view and request restocking of ingredients, and for the managers to view and manage emplyees, approve or dismiss restock requests, and view order history. This is a Windoes Forms application with multiple forms respresenting different lobbies for the different types of users. I have used C# and .NET, the database is SQL server express LocalDB for the user accounts, products, orders, etc...
